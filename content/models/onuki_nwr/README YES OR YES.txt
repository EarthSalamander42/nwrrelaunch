Animations missing:
	* Attack 2 (its fucking hard to make this fucker turning over himself, got 25% but I think I'll give up)
	* Critic Attack (Ofc, where is my money? KAPPA)
	* Channel 2 (easy to do, just out of time tonight)
	* Stun (easy to do, just out of time tonight)

Animation Speed Optimization:
	There is an option in the animation right panel which allows you to speed up an animation. Its "FPS" and it would be cool for some animations to increase this value (spell and run I.E)

Some Fails:
	I know some animations have some fails/little mistakes. Im not an animator and its my first model. Btw onoki isnt easiest model to start with because of his clothes...Im just out of luck with you all.
